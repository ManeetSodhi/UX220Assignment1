<h3>Research</h3>

When it comes to goal setting, research often shows the most successful kinds of goals are ones that aspire to <i>master</i> something rather than just maintain. These goals, however, must be set according to one's own initiative rather than enforced upon them in order to allow for a greater likelihood of them being met. If someone does not <i>aim</i> to be better at an activity they will simply not get better.<a href="#section1"><sup>1</sup></a>

In a study comparing mastery goals to performance based goals, it was shown that those who aimed for both generally outperformed anyone with a single goal orientation. This shows that you shouldn't just aim to be <i>better</i> at something but should also increase quantity or the amount of your output. As this study was specific to portolios and showcases, it shows that in a design orientated field performance is just as important as mastery.<a href="#section2"><sup>2</sup></a>
